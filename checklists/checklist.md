##   Potential Quick Wins (from cursory code review Aug 15 for app.js monolith):
  1. Error boundaries - Wrap more operations in try/catch blocks. Network calls fail randomly
  2. Debouncing - Add delays to search/filter operations to avoid excessive renders
  3. Constants - Pull out magic strings like 'routineTagsMinimized' to top-level constants
  4. Event delegation - Instead of attaching listeners to every task card, use one listener on the parent
